Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.

Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters!

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",2,know product title says molecular gastronomy let scare looking food science something earth use make coffee creamer coffee blonde sweet flavored creamers full bad kinds fat honestly hate use manufactured food items really think good body hand hate using cold milk cream like hot coffee stumbled across amazon one day got idea making creamer also bought low fat non instant milk powder regular milk powder non instant lowfat milk little sweeter tastes fresher regular instant low fat milk dissolve good cold water problem hot coffee play ratios would heavy cream made coffee rich also think powder expensive use like mixing together flavoring bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder caster superfine sugar mix small batches along spices like cinnamon nutmeg make flavored creamers wanted could use fake sweetner powder instead make small amounts store jelly canning jars also use little food chopper food processor blend everything sugar heavier sinks bottom let settle bit opening top though stuff tastes way better storebought creamers fun experiment come flavors going try using essential oils next see get good chocolate orange mix ingredients mentioned online take time experiment maybe use low fat milk add flavorings also would make great housewarming host ess gifts sure molecular people able tell sure experiment cooking main reason bought make creamer worked great

After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.

He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more ""bang for your buck"" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot!
