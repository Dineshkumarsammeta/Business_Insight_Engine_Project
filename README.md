# Project Title
*Business Insight Engine ‚Äì Real-Time Sentiment Analysis & ETL Automation*

## üìÖ Project Timeline
**Duration:** 14-Jan-2024 ‚Äì 12-March-2024  
**Location:** Master's in Advanced Computer Science, UK  
**Employer Name:** Self-initiated Academic Project  
**Reporting to:** Dr. Artur Boronat  
**Type of Project:** Real-Time Sentiment Analysis, ETL Automation (Academic Project)  

## üìå Objective
The goal of this project was to build a **cloud-native, full-stack sentiment analysis platform** capable of processing massive volumes of **real-time Twitter data**.  

Using **Apache Spark, Airflow, and AWS services**, high-throughput ETL pipelines were designed. Deep learning models (LSTM, CNN, Hybrid LSTM-CNN) and **GPT-4 via LangChain** were trained for advanced sentiment classification with over **92% accuracy**.  

The system provided **sub-second predictions**, interactive insights, and was optimized for **scalability, dependability, and cost-effectiveness**.  

## üåç Background & Relevance
With the exponential growth of social media data, businesses need **real-time insights** into customer sentiment.  

This project combines **ETL automation, advanced deep learning, and LLM-enhanced reasoning** to provide actionable intelligence for **brand monitoring, market analysis, and risk management**.  

The outcome was a **production-ready pipeline** capable of analyzing **10,000+ tweets/hour** with a 95% uptime SLA.
